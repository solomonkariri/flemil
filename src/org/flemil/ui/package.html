<p>This package contains interfaces that represent the collective properties for components that can be displayed
on the screen. Every item that can be displayed on the screen must implement the Item interface. Items that
allow scrolling of their internal or contained items must implement the Scrollable interface which extends the 
Item interface. Any Item that is used to display text to the user must implement the TextItem interface and every
Item that is to be displayed as a window must implement the Window interface. The interfaces bring together
features that are specific to Items of a certain nature as well as features that should e available for
