<p>This package contains interfaces which should be implemented by classes that wisth to be
notified when selected events occur on the items for which they are registered. The model 
used for events in Flemil is that every item for which a listener can be added will have only 
one listener registered and registered a new listener overwrites the one that had been set previously.
As a performance and resource reservation practice it is recommended to use a single listener
for a collection of elements of the same type, for example, MenuItems if its possible to uniquely 
distinguish the items by a property they pocess, for example name or can the items by be acquired
by reference. This will avoid having to initialize so may classes to listen for the events that
can be more efficiently handled by one instance of the implementation of the class. Look at the 
example that comes with this library for a sample of the use of this technique</p>
